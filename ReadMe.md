## KAID Link Inserter

### The Issue

Because users can change their usernames on a whim, a link to a user’s profile of the form (https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/username) can wind up defunct, sometimes quickly. Guardians have to be on their toes and remember to find a KAID instead of a username when sharing links to user profiles, as we’ve lost track of users in the past from not doing so. 

### The Old Way

Finding a KAID from a username requires a trip to the browser’s dev tools, or inspecting the page source, or other time-consuming and tricky actions.

### The New Way

Activate this bookmarklet, and any profile links on a page will get a second link appended immediately afterwards that uses the KAID instead of the username. Guardians can copy and paste this link with a quick click and save some work searching for that info!
